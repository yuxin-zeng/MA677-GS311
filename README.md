In Chapter 3 of G&S, Example 3.11 uses the binomial distribution to demonstrate the logic of hypothesis testing with a simple example.

In the final paragraph of the example on page 102, the authors write, "A few experiments have shown us that ... ". They report the results but donâ€™t show their experiments. Similarly, they show the Figure 3.7, but not how it was produced.

My assignment is to fill in these gaps. I produced an explanation of the example showing how the authors reached their conclusion that the critical value should be between 69 and 73 people cured. Also I replicated and explained Figure 3.7.
